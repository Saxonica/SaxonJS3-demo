# SaxonJS 3.0 demo

This repository contains a number of small examples designed to highlight
specific new features of SaxonJS 3.0.

## Prerequisites

To use this repository, you have to have Node.js version 18 installed. The build
script uses Gradle and consequently relies on Java. You don’t actually need
Java, but you’ll have to setup the build environment and compile the XSLT files
in some other way.

You also need to install the SaxonJS 3.0 release in `src/nodejs/saxonjs3`.

## TL;DR

Run `./gradlew server` to configure and install the demo.

Open `http://localhost:3002/` in your browser.

The source code for the demos is in `src`.
